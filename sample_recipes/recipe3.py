INGREDIENTS = [
  '1/2 tablespoon butter',
  '2 large eggs',
  '1 tablespoon whole milk',
  '1/8 teaspoon salt',
  'Fresh cracked pepper',
  'Mix-ins, like leftover meat, cooked vegetables, cheese, or herbs'
]

STEPS = [
  '''Melt the butter:
  Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.''',
  '''Whisk the eggs:
  Crack two eggs into a small mixing bowl. Add milk and salt. Aggressively whisk the mixture until it is uniform in color, texture, and slightly foamy. You want the whites and yolks fully combined.''',
  '''Scramble the eggs:
  Add the eggs to hot skillet and immediately reduce the heat to medium low. Use a rubber spatula to push the eggs from one end of the skillet to the other.

  Continue doing this, gently and slowly, always pushing the cooked eggs from the bottom of the skillet and allowing the uncooked egg to take its place.

  When the eggs are mostly cooked, but look fairly wet with what looks like thick liquidy egg around the curds, slowly fold the eggs into itself one or two times. You want to bring the eggs together, kind of like a loose ball of dough. Add any cheese, meat or vegetables at this time.''',
  '''Serve immediately:
  Remove eggs from pan when the eggs are set but still glisten with moisture, and transfer to a plate. Finish with freshly cracked pepper. Garnish with fresh herbs, if using.'''
